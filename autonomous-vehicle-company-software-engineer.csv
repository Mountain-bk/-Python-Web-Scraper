Since our start as the Google Self-Driving Car Project in 2009, Waymo has been focused on building the Worldâs Most Experienced Driver in hopes of improving the world's access to mobility while saving thousands of lives now lost to traffic crashes. Our Waymo Driver powers Waymo One, our autonomous ride-hailing service, as well as Waymo Via, our trucking and local delivery service. To date, Waymo has driven over 20 million miles autonomously on public roads across 25 U.S. cities and conducted over 15 billion miles of simulation testing.
Perception infrastructure involves both onboard and offboard systems. The onboard perception system runs on the self-driving car. It is an extremely high functionality and high performance real-time system. The onboard perception system processes all the sensor inputs of lidars, cameras, radars, and audio. One core design principle of the perception onboard system is to be ML effective, both in terms of running ML models onboard with very low latency, as well as integrating all the ML models into a cohesive system.
The offboard perception infrastructure supports engineering development of the onboard system. It sits on the interface of machine learning and systems. It supports our expansive ML development including data extraction, evaluation, debugging / visualization, data mining, etc.. It also supports systems development including testing, performance analysis, deployment, etc. Waymo has a massive amount of sensor data logged from real-world driving, which is key to our engineering development. Robust and scalable perception offboard infrastructure is at the core of engineering excellence. 
 
In this role, depending on preference and role fit, you will


Work on the onboard perception system, where youâll get to build an overall picture of the entire perception stack, conduct latency measurements and analysis, optimize system performance, make software design changes as needed, etc. Or,


Work on the offboard perception system, where youâll learn the nitty-gritty details of the infrastructure to build ML models that actually works in the real world, design and implement ML/perception infrastructure to enable Waymo scale to many more cities and thousands of cars, directly interact with and enable many ML developers to achieve cutting-edge self-driving perception, etc. Or,


Work on both of the above.


 
Weâd like you to have:


Strong in C++ and system design.


Excited about building solutions to complex problems.


Willingness to get your hands dirty and go full stack if need be.


Experience in robotics or machine learning.


 
Ideally, you also have:


Experience in deploying a large production system with many ML models.


Experience in optimizing high-performance systems.

At Waymo, weâre focused on bringing self-driving technology to the world. Our mission is to make it safe and easy for people and things to move around. Today, our driverless cars are serving our first customers with no drivers behind the wheel. To experience our self-driving technology, see this 360-degree video.
The Planner Evaluation team is working on one of the most challenging problems in autonomous driving: evaluating whether our autonomous cars are good drivers.  Beyond keeping our cars from colliding with things, we need to ensure that they donât scare other drivers, pedestrians, or other people on the road (or their own passengers), that the ride they provide is comfortable, and that theyâre following the rules of the road.  At Waymo we have a ton of extremely rich data from which to extract relevant signals--if you like working with data, geometric reasoning, simulation, and/or machine learning, this is the place for you!
 
Evaluating our driving performance in a data-driven manner is both challenging and exciting--and by creating the metrics that define what good driving is, we can influence and improve onboard code both indirectly (by providing the quality signals for onboard engineers to aim for) and directly (by working with onboard engineers to incorporate signals into our motion planning code).
 
To work on these complex challenges, we are bringing together experts from a wide variety of backgrounds, including data science, robotics, machine learning, and software architecture and infrastructure.  We are seeking enthusiastic software engineers and data scientists to jump into this problem space and solve novel problems with us at the intersection of robotics, data science and software.
 
Background in robotics is not required - a history of strong performance on deep quantitative or software problems from other fields broadens our team's expertise and point of view, and is highly valued.  We seek particularly people with experience/interest in a mixture of extracting signals from large scale data and software engineering, and who are interested in learning about robotics and motion planning.
 
Join us and you will work closely with robotics experts to deeply understand our motion planning system and improve the performance of the Waymo driver!
 
Qualifications:

PhD in some quantitative area (preferred, but other backgrounds considered) + 3 years of industry experience
Extensive background working with data, either in academia or industry
Either solid software engineering toolkit or deep statistical and/or ML knowledge 
Enthusiasm to understand a complex system and its various components
Experience with C++ and Python

Argo-AI,"Perception Lead (Tracking, Sensor Fusion)",https://www.argo.ai/join-us/#j2344881,"Python, C++","At Argo AI, we are working to transform the world of transportation by bringing fully autonomous self-driving cars safely into widespread use.  We already have some of the world’s most experienced leaders in the field, with expertise ranging from complex robotics algorithms to production software development to sophisticated hardware design and production.  We are looking for highly motivated, technically deep engineers and applied scientists to join our team and help us realize this vision.
Perception Lead:
Perception (tracking, detection) is a core technical problem for L4 self-driving vehicles and a key part of our autonomy stack. Self-driving cars need to track actors around the vehicle to make the correct decisions. The implementation must meet rigorous real time constraints and report stable tracks for the car to accurately identify the 3D state of the world. Ultimately, we must not only solve the algorithm challenges but produce safety-quality high performance software. So this position is as much a software challenge as it is a core algorithm challenge.
We are looking for hands on candidates who can set the vision for, grow and manage strong technical teams with a mixture of vision, probabilistic filtering and lidar algorithm experience and strong software experience. We are looking for a team lead who will be deep in code and is technically strong in software and (ideally) strong in tracking and detection algorithms -- segmentation, clustering, data association, multi-extended object tracking and filtering, MHT or other registration algorithms. Candidates need not have worked on self-driving or robotics applications. Candidates with extremely strong skills in some areas but weaker in others will be considered with a bias towards strong software engineering skills. The ideal candidate skill set includes:
Strong software engineering skills are required but we are language agnostic. A willingness to gain stronger software engineering knowledge and deep expertise in C++ and/or python is required.
Strong leadership skills suitable for recruiting, leading and managing a team of engineers to solve a challenging problem and build a critical component of a real-time system.
Strong theoretical and applied knowledge of relevant subsets of tracking-relevant algorithms.
Strong desire for candidates with hands on experience that have deployed real products or platforms into the real world and intimately understand the challenges of working with complex systems.
Strong presentation and communication skills are desired.
ROLE DESCRIPTION:
As the lead for the perception team, you’ll be responsible for a critical piece of the system:
The component of the self driving vehicle keeping track in space and time of objects around the car.
Leading the team to advance the algorithmic performance through pragmatic and rigorous A vs B evaluations using a mix of state of the art or “classical” techniques
Ensure that the algorithms are integrated within our onboard infrastructure and hardware, are robustly implemented and run in real time
Coordinate with data collection to select and label relevant data to improve our tracking algorithms.
Manage 2 to 3 teams of ~5 engineers and researchers on each team.
  SKILLS, EXPERTISE, EDUCATION AND PRIOR EXPERIENCE:
Required Skills, Expertise, Education & Experience:
Experienced software engineer working on problems with advanced algorithms or researcher with a track record of real world applications involving solid software engineering.
Managed or tech lead small teams.
C++
Python
Real-time applications
Advanced probabilistic, machine learning or similar algorithms
Preferred or Desired Skills, Expertise, Education & Experience:
This is a role that involves building real time software, but also dealing with some technically and mathematically deep algorithms. While they don’t need to be the world’s expert on tracking, the candidate does need to be able to get up to speed quickly on the algorithm space and mathematical underpinnings and be able to hire candidates that are strong in probabilistic state estimation and registration as well as bring strong software engineering practice to bear.
Some subset of: Tracking, computer vision, SLAM, lidar, robotics, state estimation, machine learning, image or lidar registration.
Needs to be strongly familiar with probabilistic algorithms.
  At Argo AI, we have a strong emphasis on creating a highly effective team environment. Thus, we seek candidates that can work effectively with others in small project teams, but can also be self-directed in independently pursuing broadly-scoped technical goals.
Argo AI is an equal opportunity employer that believes in diversity as a strength. 
Benefits include:
Full, high quality health/dental/vision insurance.
401(k) plan with employer match.
Paid company holidays and extensive vacation."

Prediction is a core technical problem for L4 self-driving vehicles and a key part of our autonomy stack. For a self-driving vehicle to navigate the world safely and efficiently, it needs to reliably infer the underlying intent of other objects (such as vehicles, pedestrians, bicyclists) by analyzing the perception data. Fundamentally, this is a machine learning problem involving multiple interacting agents subject to real-time performance constraints. We are looking for candidates with deep machine learning expertise that have built and deployed software systems to solve real world problems. Candidates need not have worked on self-driving, or robotics applications.

Meet the team:
Tracking is a core technical problem for L4 self-driving vehicles and a key part of our autonomy stack. Self-driving cars need to track actors and estimate velocities around the vehicle to enable rapid and accurate decision making. The implementation must meet rigorous real-time constraints and report stable tracks for the car to accurately identify the 3D state of the world. Ultimately, we must not only solve the algorithm challenges but produce safety-quality high performance software. So this position is as much a software challenge as it is a core algorithm challenge.
We are looking for hands on candidates who can set the vision for, grow, and lead a strong technical team with a mix of vision, probabilistic filtering and LiDAR algorithm experience and strong software experience. We are looking for a team lead who will be deep in code, and is technically strong in software and strong in tracking algorithms -- segmentation, clustering, data association, multi-extended object tracking and filtering, MHT or other registration algorithms. Candidates need not have worked on self-driving, or robotics applications.
