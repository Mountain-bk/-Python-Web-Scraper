To date, Waymo has driven over 20 million miles autonomously on public roads across 25 U.S. cities and conducted over 15 billion miles of simulation testing.
At Waymo, weâre focused on bringing self-driving technology to the world. Our mission is to make it safe and easy for people and things to move around. Today, our driverless cars are serving our first customers with no drivers behind the wheel. To experience our self-driving technology, see this 360-degree video.
The Planner Evaluation team is working on one of the most challenging problems in autonomous driving: evaluating whether our autonomous cars are good drivers.  Beyond keeping our cars from colliding with things, we need to ensure that they donât scare other drivers, pedestrians, or other people on the road (or their own passengers), that the ride they provide is comfortable, and that theyâre following the rules of the road.  At Waymo we have a ton of extremely rich data from which to extract relevant signals--if you like working with data, geometric reasoning, simulation, and/or machine learning, this is the place for you!
 
Evaluating our driving performance in a data-driven manner is both challenging and exciting--and by creating the metrics that define what good driving is, we can influence and improve onboard code both indirectly (by providing the quality signals for onboard engineers to aim for) and directly (by working with onboard engineers to incorporate signals into our motion planning code).
 
To work on these complex challenges, we are bringing together experts from a wide variety of backgrounds, including data science, robotics, machine learning, and software architecture and infrastructure.  We are seeking enthusiastic software engineers and data scientists to jump into this problem space and solve novel problems with us at the intersection of robotics, data science and software.
 
Background in robotics is not required - a history of strong performance on deep quantitative or software problems from other fields broadens our team's expertise and point of view, and is highly valued.  We seek particularly people with experience/interest in a mixture of extracting signals from large scale data and software engineering, and who are interested in learning about robotics and motion planning.
 
Join us and you will work closely with robotics experts to deeply understand our motion planning system and improve the performance of the Waymo driver!
 
Qualifications:

PhD in some quantitative area (preferred, but other backgrounds considered) + 3 years of industry experience
Extensive background working with data, either in academia or industry
Either solid software engineering toolkit or deep statistical and/or ML knowledge 
Enthusiasm to understand a complex system and its various components
Experience with C++ and Python
