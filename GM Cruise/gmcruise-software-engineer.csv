The Autonomous Vehicle (AV) software stack heavily relies on machine learning techniques to perform a variety of tasks, each with different requirements of hardware/compute resources. Throughout the life-cycle of each machine learning model, skilled ML engineers (on both training and inference sides) work closely to prepare it for a robust, scalable, and compute/power efficient inferencing on a resource-constrained hardware accelerator. Such a close working relationship is key to fast and successful deployment of intelligent systems on the car.
Cruise is looking for a deep learning compiler engineer to build the compiler and software tool chain for deploying machine learning models on to a variety of ML hardware accelerators. In this position, you will contribute, develop and enhance Cruise’s internal ML compiler infrastructure for high-performance and retargetability possibly by leveraging open-source technology like LLVM, TVM and XLA.
In this role, you will collaborate closely with engineers from different AV Engineering teams (e.g. Computer Vision, Perception, platform) to scope out system/software requirements at the application level while engaging with AV hardware teams to understand the target hardware platform and its constraints.
If you're interested in optimizing machine learning inference on different hardware accelerators, and want to test your skills with real-world (and practical) applications in the autonomous vehicle domain, let's chat!
What you'll be doing: 
Design, implement and test compiler features and capabilities related to IR infrastructure and compiler passes
Develop graph compiler optimizations like operator fusion, layout optimization, etc that are customized to each of the different ML accelerators in the system
Integrate open-source and vendor compiler technology in to Cruise’s internal compiler infrastructure
Build performance tooling to evaluate, understand and improve ML performance on different accelerators
Collaborate with cross functional agile teams of AV engineers to guide the direction of inferencing and provide requirements and feature requests for hardware vendors
Closely follow industry and academic developments in the ML compiler domain and provide performance guidelines and best practices for other ML engineers
What you must have:
5+ years of experience in the field of compiler design and 2+ years of experience with deep learning
Experience with deep learning frameworks (e.g., Tensorflow, etc) and software stack (e.g., TensorRT, TVM, etc)
