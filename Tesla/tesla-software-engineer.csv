Senior Software Tools Engineer– Industrial Storage ,"The Role 
The Tesla Energy Product and Service Engineering team is looking for an innovative, experienced, driven individual to develop software tools to support the explosive growth of our Industrial Storage fleet.  We are seeking a senior software developer to lead the creation of tools that will be used to interactively diagnosis why a system is not working as expected in the field.  These tools will be used by Tesla engineers and technicians working on our commercial and utility scale batteries deployed around the world to rapidly root cause a problem, identify the required fix, and verify the system is working properly after the fix has been applied.  You will work with a team of engineers to develop custom tools that will communicate with and control the power converters, digital control systems, heating and cooling systems in Tesla’s industrial batteries.  The software tool will decode and interact with CAN and Profinet data and will be capable of interaction with any individual ECU or group of ECU’s up to an entire battery block. You will be the primary developer of the software and will drive the software and firmware requests from related teams to facilitate the field team support software.   
  Responsibilities 
Lead the development of the field service software tool 
Directly interact with the field service team to identify detailed requirements for creating and improving the field service software tool 
Develop software that can directly interact with the Tesla industrial batteries, or any subcomponent of that system 
Work with the ECU programmer/owners for subcomponents of the Tesla industrial battery system to develop custom software to perform diagnostic procedures on individual – isolated – subcomponents of the system 
Write software to interact with custom rest apis, CAN bus data, Profinet and Modbus controls 
Create diagnostic interfaces that allow for the rapid, precise diagnosis of issues in complex systems and are a visual representation of the system being worked on 
Work with the firmware team to obtain dbc files and develop a system for automatically synchronizing dbc files and updated software to field tech computers 
Work with the security team for regular reviews of the field service software tool 
Develop a system for rollouts of updates to the software to a global team of technicians and engineers. 
Develop documentation and training for the field service techs using the tool you develop 
Must Have Requirements 
BS in electrical, computer, or software engineering with 4-8 years of experience or MS degree with 2-5 years of experience in power electronics, power converters, control systems, or embedded systems, or software to interact with and control custom hardware 
Proven cross-functional leadership and collaborative skills  
Strong engineering fundamentals and intuition, applied to power electronics or firmware/software-enabled mechatronic systems  
Relevant work experience – including significant first-hand experience with electronics design, electronics failure analysis, system test engineering, reliability engineering, or product engineering or user interface programming for custom electromechanical systems 
Excellent oral, written communication skills 
An ability to prioritize and execute many tasks in parallel.  Excellent attention to detail and an ability to produce clear and concise written documents and diagrams  
Nice to Have Requirements 
Experience using Python or equivalent for creating custom user interfaces 
Experience with battery systems and power systems  
Work travel is expected to be around 5% for this role.  This would include traveling to customer sites as well as our manufacturing and engineering facilities in the US. "
